Here's a sneak peek at components currently in active development and those planned for the future:

### Freshly Sprouted

Newly added components that are available right now!

<div className="mt-2 grid grid-rows-3 sm:grid-rows-1 sm:grid-cols-3 gap-3">
    <NewComponent
        name="Chip"
        description="Interactive badges used to represent user-generated content."
    />
    <NewComponent
        name="Dialog"
        description="A window overlaid on either the primary window or another dialog window, rendering the content underneath inert."
    />
    <NewComponent
        name="Popover"
        description="Displays rich content in a portal, triggered by a button."
    />
</div>

### Blooming Soon

Currently in active development, and will be added very soon.

-   TODO

You can track the development progress of these components on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/waseem-polus/wysteria/issues).

### Seedling Ideas

On the roadmap but no planned realease date yet.

-   Grid Layout
-   Callout
-   Switch
-   Accordion

Just like wisteria vines start as small seeds and grow into stunning displays, our components are evolving and expanding. We can't wait to share them with you!
